            <h2>Tragic Outcome of Ebenezer Scrooge’s Greed</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>LONDON, December 25, 1843</strong> — Tiny Tim, the young son of Bob Cratchit, died on Christmas Day because Ebenezer Scrooge's refusal to change his ways. His tragic death has shaken the Cratchit family and left the community into heartbreak.

                It all began a year ago, when Scrooge received the visits of three ghosts warning him against what would result as an consequences from his greed: The Ghost of Christmas Past showed him memories of a time when at least some love existed in his life. The Ghost of Christmas Present showed him the suffering of the Cratchit family, especially young Tiny Tim. Finally, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come revealed a dark future where Tiny Tim’s death went unnoticed, and Scrooge himself was left alone and unloved.

                As nobody expected, Scrooge’s heart remained cold. He did not give a attention to what the ghosts had to tell him and refused to change and go on his ways. Besides the way he treated Bob Cratchit, the heartless treatment of his employees left little room for warmth or generosity in his life. More than all this, Scrooge did not step in to help Tiny Tim, even though the little boy’s condition grew worse by the day.

                Unfortunately, without his support, Tiny Tim had grown ever weaker and died this Christmas morning. The Cratchit family is now devastated by this loss, and their future without their boy seems so cold the town also mourns the passing of a child who, though sick in body, was noted for courage and gentleness.

                Scrooge, who recently was given an opportunity to change his life, must live with the understanding that his inability and complete refusal to listen to the spirits led to this heartbreaking result. According to experts, such tragedy might have been avoided if only Scrooge had chosen to embrace the spirit of Christmas and shown benevolence toward people in distress.

                "It is a sad reminder that we’ve got to look after each other, especially this time of Christmas," said a local pastor. "The family of Cratchit and the fate of Tiny Tim might have turned out different, had Scrooge chosen to love rather than greed."
            </p>
            <p>
                With Christmas Day melting into night, Scrooge now faces the lonely reality of having to live with the consequences of his action the community remembering forever the boy who died too soon.
